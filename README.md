# MyCourseLevel
MyCourseLevel is a simple web application designed to simulate a course browsing system for Saint Leo University but can be used for other universities as well.
It includes a homepage, login page, and dynamic courses page powered by JSON data.
The project demonstrates the ability to build a functional Node.js + Express application, organize front-end pages, and serve them through a backend server.

This application is part of an academic assignment demonstrating:

Web application structure

HTML/CSS/JS frontend development

Express.js server setup

JSON data integration

GitHub repository management

Deployment through GitHub Codespaces
